## TrustLayer Coding Challenge

The TrustLayer Coding Challenge asks that a small project be build that stores quizzes and users in a persistent datastore. This datastore will allow Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations by an authenticated and authorized user. CRUD operations must be performed via an API with a REST or GraphQL interface. These are the broad strokes.
